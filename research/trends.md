# Full-stack trends â€” Day 1 notes

- MERN & full-stack JS: Popular for fast MVPs and learning full-stack concepts.
- Next.js & React Server Components: Hybrid SSR/SSG; great for production apps & SEO.
- Serverless / Edge functions: Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare Workers for small scalable services.
- BaaS (Firebase / Supabase): Realtime DB + Auth speeds prototypes.
- TypeScript: Increasingly preferred for reliability on larger teams.

Why I chose MongoDB: small setup overhead and works smoothly with Node.js in this 7-day sprint.
